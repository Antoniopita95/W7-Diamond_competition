# W7-Diamond Proyect
## Introduction

The final weekly project in the Data Analytics Bootcamp is a competition to find the best model for prediction diamond prices based on nine given variables:
    - carat
    - cut
    - color
    - clarity
    - depth
    - table
    - x
    - y
    - z

Two datasets were given as part of the competition: one for training the models, including the actual price, and one without prices to test the models 

## Libraries used

During the project, I have used the following libraries:
- [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
